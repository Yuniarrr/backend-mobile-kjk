1	The World of Cybersecurity	What Is Cybersecurity?	Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.	[     {         "title": "Personal",         "content": "On a personal level, you need to safeguard your identity, your data, and your computing devices."     },     {         "title": "Organizational",         "content": "At an organizational level, it is everyone's responsibility to protect the organization's reputation, data and customers.s"     },     {         "title": "Government",         "content": "As more digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and wellbeing of citizens are at stake."     } ]
2	The World of Cybersecurity	Protecting Your Personal Data	Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you, and it can exist both offline and online.  Many people think that if they don’t have any social media or online accounts set up, then they don’t have an online identity. This is not the case. If you use the web, you have an online identity.	[     {         "title": "Offline identity",         "content": "Your offline identity is the real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at school or at work. As a result, family and friends know details about your personal life, including your full name, age and address. It's important not to overlook the importance of securing your offline identity. Identity thieves can easily steal your data from right under your nose when you're not looking!"     },     {         "title": "Online identity",         "content": "Your online identity is not just a name. It's who you are and how you present yourself to others online. It includes the username or alias you use for your online accounts, as well as the social identity you establish and portray on online communities and websites. You should take care to limit the amount of personal information you reveal through your online identity."     } ]
3	The World of Cybersecurity	Your Online Identity	It’s your first day on the job, and it’s time to choose a username for your online identity. Which of the following options would you choose?  When choosing a username, it’s important not to reveal any personal information.  Some other useful tips to help you generate your username: •        Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number. •        Don’t use your email username. •        Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts. •        Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track. •        Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters, the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT. •        Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.	
4	The World of Cybersecurity	Your Data	Personal data describes any information about you, including your name, social security number, driver license number, date and place of birth, your mother’s maiden name, and even pictures or messages that you exchange with family and friends.  Cybercriminals can use this sensitive information to identify and impersonate you, infringing on your privacy and potentially causing serious damage to your reputation.	[     {         "title": "Medical records",         "content": "Every time you visit the doctor, personal information regarding your physical and mental health and wellbeing is added to your electronic health records (EHRs). Since the majority of these records are saved online, you need to be aware of the medical information that you share. And these records go beyond the bounds of the doctor's office. For example, many fitness trackers collect large amounts of clinical data such as your heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, which is transferred, stored and displayed via the cloud. Therefore, you should consider this data to be part of your medical records."     },     {         "title": "Education records",         "content": "Educational records contain information about your academic qualifications and achievements. However, these records may also include your contact information, attendance records, disciplinary reports, health and immunization records as well as any special education records including individualized education programs (IEPs)."     },     {         "title": "Employment and financial records",         "content": "Employment data can be valuable to hackers if they can gather information on your past employment, or even your current performance reviews. Your financial records may include information about your income and expenditure. Your tax records may include paychecks, credit card statements, your credit rating and your bank account details. All of this data, if not safeguarded properly, can compromise your privacy and enable cybercriminals to use your information for their own gain."     } ]
5	The World of Cybersecurity	Where Is Your Data?	This has got you thinking. Only yesterday, you shared a couple of photos of your first day on the job with a few of your close friends. But that should be OK, right? Let’s see…  You took some photos at work on your mobile phone. Copies of these photos are now available on your mobile device.  You shared these with five close friends, who live in various locations across the world.  All of your friends downloaded the photos and now have copies of your photos on their devices.  One of your friends was so proud that they decided to post and share your photos online. The photos are no longer just on your device. They have in fact ended up on servers located in different parts of the world and people whom you don’t even know now have access to your photos. 	
6	The World of Cybersecurity	What's More...	This is just one example that reminds us that every time we collect or share personal data, we should consider our security. There are different laws that protect your privacy and data in your country. But do you know where your data is?	[     {         "title": "Medical records",         "content": "Following an appointment, the doctor will update your medical record. For billing purposes, this information may be shared with the insurance company. In such cases, your medical record, or part of it, is now accessible at the insurance company."     },     {         "title": "Employment and financial records",         "content": "Store loyalty cards may be a convenient way to save money on your purchases. However, the store is using this card to build a profile of your purchasing behavior, which it can then use to target you with special offers from its marketing partners."     } ]
7	The World of Cybersecurity	Smart Devices	Consider how often you use your computing devices to access your personal data. Unless you have chosen to receive paper statements, you probably access digital copies of bank account statements via your bank’s website. And when paying a bill, it’s highly likely that you’ve transferred the required funds via a mobile banking app.  But besides allowing you to access your information, computing devices can now also generate information about you.  Wearable technologies such as smartwatches and activity trackers collect your data for clinical research, patient health monitoring, and fitness and wellbeing tracking. As the global fitness tracker market grows, so also does the risk to your personal data.	
8	The World of Cybersecurity	What Do Hackers Want?	So, with all this information about you available online, what do hackers want? Of course, they want your money.  Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or read about, where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information online?  Were you able to think of at least one example?  A cybercriminal can take advantage of your relationships, accessing your online accounts and appealing to your good nature to try and trick you into wiring money to your friends or family in a time of need. For example, there have been many reported cases of hackers impersonating family members and sending messages stating that they need money wired in order to get home from abroad after losing their wallets.  And while you may think that your frequent flyer air miles are not valuable to cybercriminals, think again. In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts, booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials. Even though the frequent flyer miles were returned to the customers by the airlines, this example demonstrates the value of your login credentials.	
9	The World of Cybersecurity	Identity Theft	Not content with stealing your money for short-term financial gain, cybercriminals are invested in the long-term gain of identity theft.	[     {         "title": "Medical theft",         "content": "Rising medical costs have led to an increase in medical identity theft, with cybercriminals stealing medical insurance to use the benefits for themselves. Where this happens, any medical procedures carried out in your name will then be saved in your medical records."     },     {         "title": "Banking",         "content": "Stealing private data can help cybercriminals access bank accounts, credit cards, social profiles and other online accounts. Armed with this information, an identity thief could file a fake tax return and collect the refund. They could even take out loans in your name and ruin your credit rating (and your life as well)."     } ]
10	The World of Cybersecurity	Who Else Wants My Data?	It’s not just criminals who seek your personal data.	[     {         "title": "Your Internet service provider (ISP)",         "content": "Your ISP tracks your online activity and, in some countries, they can sell this data to advertisers for a profit.

11	Organizational Data	Types of Organizational Data		[     {         "title": "Traditional Data",         "content": "Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small. It includes the following: Transactional data such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment decisions. Intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a company.Financial data such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which provide insight into the health of a company."     },     {         "title": "Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data",         "content": "IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these 'things' are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it's no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'"     } ]
12	Organizational Data	The Cube	The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:  1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems. 2. The protection of information in each of its possible states. 3. The security measures used to protect data.	[     {         "title": "Confidentiality",         "content": "Confidentiality is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized people, resources and processes.

13	Organizational Data	Is This for Real?	Yes, phishing is very common and often works. For example, in August 2020, elite gaming brand Razer experienced a data breach which exposed the personal information of approximately 100,000 customers.  A security consultant discovered that a cloud cluster (a group of linked servers providing data storage, databases, networking, and software through the Internet), was misconfigured and exposed a segment of Razer’s infrastructure to the public Internet, resulting in a data leak.   It took Razer more than three weeks to secure the cloud instance from public access, during which time cybercriminals had access to customer information that could have been used in social engineering and fraud attacks, like the one you uncovered just now.   Organizations therefore need to take a proactive approach to cloud security to ensure that sensitive data is secured.	
14	Organizational Data	Data Security Breaches	The implications of a data security breach are severe, but they are becoming all too common.	[     {         "title": "The Persirai botnet",         "content": "In 2017, an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet, Persirai, targeted over 1,000 different models of Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, accessing open ports to inject a command that forced the cameras to connect to a site which installed malware on them. Once the malware was downloaded and executed, it deleted itself and was therefore able to run in memory to avoid detection. Over 122,000 of these cameras from several different manufacturers were hijacked and used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, without the knowledge of their owners. A DDoS attack occurs when multiple devices infected with malware flood the resources of a targeted system.The IoT is connecting more and more devices, creating more opportunities for cybercriminals to attack."     },     {         "title": "Equifax Inc.",         "content": "In September 2017, Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency in the United States, publicly announced a data breach event: Attackers had been able to exploit a vulnerability in its web application software to gain access to the sensitive personal data of millions of customers. In response to this breach, Equifax established a dedicated website that allowed Equifax customers to determine if their information was compromised. However, instead of using a subdomain of equifax.com, the company set up a new domain name, which allowed cybercriminals to create unauthorized websites with similar names. These websites were used to try and trick customers into providing personal information. Attackers could use this information to assume a customer’s identity. In such cases, it would be very difficult for the customer to prove otherwise, given that the hacker is also privy to their personal information."     } ]

16	What was taken?	What Happened?		
17	What was taken?	What Exploits?	What exploits did the hackers use in this case to gain access to valuable personal information?  Hackers are targeting the increasing numbers of organizations who are migrating to the cloud or using cloud-based services and resources.  In this scenario, hackers were able to take advantage of an organization’s poor security practices. Unsecured cloud databases left exposed on the Internet present a huge vulnerability and one that attackers will seek to exploit to gain easy access to valuable organizational data.  	
18	Cyber Attackers	Types of Attackers	Let’s look at some of the main types of cyber attackers who’ll try anything to get their hands on our information. They are often categorized as white hat, gray hat or black hat attackers.	[     {         "title": "Amateurs",         "content": "The term 'script kiddies' emerged in the 1990s and refers to amateur or inexperienced hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some script kiddies are just curious, others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. While script kiddies may use basic tools, their attacks can still have devastating consequences."     },     {         "title": "Hackers",         "content": "This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers."     },     {         "title": "Organized hackers",         "content": "These attackers include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and state-sponsored hackers. They are usually highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service to other criminals. Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness about issues that are important to them. State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. They are usually highly trained and well-funded and their attacks are focused on specific goals that are beneficial to their government."     } ]
19	Cyber Attackers	Internal and External Threats	Cyber attacks can originate from within an organization as well as from outside of it.	[     {         "title": "Internal",         "content": "Employees, contract staff or trusted partners can accidentally or intentionally: mishandle confidential data, facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the organization's computer system, invite malware onto the organization's network by clicking on malicious emails or websites, threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices."     },     {         "title": "External",         "content": "Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can: exploit vulnerabilities in the network, gain unauthorized access to computing devices, use social engineering to gain unauthorized access to organizational data."     } ]
20	Cyberwarfare	The Purpose of Cyberwarfare	The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.	[     {         "title": "To gather compromised information and/or defense secrets",         "content": "A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its industries and military capabilities. Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel within a foreign government."     },     {         "title": "To impact another nation's infrastructure",         "content": "Besides industrial and military espionage, a nation can continuously invade another nation's infrastructure in order to cause disruption and chaos. For example, a cyber attack could shut down the power grid of a major city. Consider the consequences if this were to happen; roads would be congested, the exchange of goods and services would be halted, patients would not be able to get the care they would need if an emergency occurred, access to the internet would be interrupted. By shutting down a power grid, a cyber attack could have a huge impact on the everyday life of ordinary citizens."     } ]
21	Analyzing a Cyber Attack	Types of Malware	Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they spread is key to containing and removing them.	[     {         "title": "Spyware",         "content": "Designed to track and spy on you, spyware monitors your online activity and can log every key you press on your keyboard, as well as capture almost any of your data, including sensitive personal information such as your online banking details.

Scareware mainly consists of operating system style windows that pop up to warn you that your system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to return to normal operation. If you agree to execute the specific program, your system will become infected with malware."     },     {         "title": "Rootkit",         "content": "This malware is designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers can then use to access your computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software vulnerabilities to gain access to resources that normally shouldn't be accessible (privilege escalation) and modify system files. Rootkits can also modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect.

Worms share similar patterns: They exploit system vulnerabilities, they have a way to propagate themselves, and they all contain malicious code (payload) to cause damage to computer systems or networks."     } ]
22	Analyzing a Cyber Attack	Symptoms of Malware	So now you know about the different kinds of malware. But what do you think their symptoms might be?  Regardless of the type of malware a system has been infected with, there are some common symptoms to look out for. These include:  •        an increase in central processing unit (CPU) usage, which slows down your device •        your computer freezing or crashing often •        a decrease in your web browsing speed •        unexplainable problems with your network connections •        modified or deleted files •        the presence of unknown files, programs or desktop icons •        unknown processes running •        programs turning off or reconfiguring themselves •        emails being sent without your knowledge or consent.	
23	Methods of Infiltration	Social Engineering	Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access.	[     {         "title": "Pretexting",         "content": "This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data.For example, pretending to need a person's personal or financial data in order to confirm their identity."     },     {         "title": "Tailgating",         "content": "This is when an attacker quickly follows an authorized person into a secure, physical location."     },     {         "title": "Something for something (quid pro quo)",         "content": "This is when an attacker requests personal information from a person in exchange for something, like a free gift."     } ]
24	Methods of Infiltration	Denial-of-Service	Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.	[     {         "title": "Overwhelming quantity of traffic",         "content": "This is when a network, host or application is sent an enormous amount of data at a rate which it cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or the device or service to crash."     },     {         "title": "Maliciously formatted packets",         "content": "A packet is a collection of data that flows between a source and a receiver computer or application over a network, such as the Internet. When a maliciously formatted packet is sent, the receiver will be unable to handle it. For example, if an attacker forwards packets containing errors or improperly formatted packets that cannot be identified by an application, this will cause the receiving device to run very slowly or crash."     } ]
25	Methods of Infiltration	Distributed DoS	A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. For example:  •        An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by handler systems. •        The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies. •        When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.	
26	Methods of Infiltration	Botnet	A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server.  These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.  Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify any botnet locations.	
27	Methods of Infiltration	On-Path Attacks	On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices.  This type of attack is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mobile attack.	[     {         "title": "Man In The Middle (MITM)",         "content": "A MitM attack happens when a cybercriminal takes control of a device without the user's knowledge. With this level of access, an attacker can intercept and capture user information before it is sent to its intended destination. These types of attacks are often used to steal financial information. There are many types of malware that possess MitM attack capabilities."     },     {         "title": "Man In The Mobile (MITMO)",         "content": "A variation of man-in-middle, MitMo is a type of attack used to take control over a user's mobile device. When infected, the mobile device is instructed to exfiltrate user-sensitive information and send it to the attackers. ZeuS is one example of a malware package with MitMo capabilities. It allows attackers to quietly capture two-step verification SMS messages that are sent to users."     } ]
28	Methods of Infiltration	SEO Poisoning	You’ve probably heard of search engine optimization or SEO which, in simple terms, is about improving an organization’s website so that it gains greater visibility in search engine results.  Search engines such as Google work by presenting a list of web pages to users based on their search query. These web pages are ranked according to the relevancy of their content.  While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them, attackers take advantage of popular search terms and use SEO to push malicious sites higher up the ranks of search results. This technique is called SEO poisoning.  The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or attempt social engineering.	
29	Methods of Infiltration	Password Attacks	Entering a username and password is one of the most popular forms of authenticating to a web site. Therefore, uncovering your password is an easy way for cybercriminals to gain access to your most valuable information.	[     {         "title": "Password spraying",         "content": "This technique attempts to gain access to a system by 'spraying' a few commonly used passwords across a large number of accounts. For example, a cybercriminal uses 'Password123' with many usernames before trying again with a second commonly-used password, such as 'qwerty.' This technique allows the perpetrator to remain undetected as they avoid frequent account lockouts."     },     {         "title": "Dictionary attacks",         "content": "A hacker systematically tries every word in a dictionary or a list of commonly used words as a password in an attempt to break into a password-protected account."     },     {         "title": "Brute-force attacks",         "content": "The simplest and most commonly used way of gaining access to a password-protected site, brute-force attacks see an attacker using all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols in the password space until they get it right."     },     {         "title": "Rainbow attacks",         "content": "Passwords in a computer system are not stored as plain text, but as hashed values (numerical values that uniquely identify data). A rainbow table is a large dictionary of precomputed hashes and the passwords from which they were calculated. Unlike a brute-force attack that has to calculate each hash, a rainbow attack compares the hash of a password with those stored in the rainbow table. When an attacker finds a match, they identify the password used to create the hash."     },     {         "title": "Traffic interception",         "content": "Plain text or unencrypted passwords can be easily read by other humans and machines by intercepting communications. If you store a password in clear, readable text, anyone who has access to your account or device, whether authorized or unauthorized, can read it."     } ]
30	Methods of Infiltration	Advanced Persistent Threats	Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs.  Due to the complexity and the skill level required to carry out such an attack, an APT is usually well-funded and typically targets organizations or nations for business or political reasons.  Its main purpose is to deploy customized malware on one or more of the target’s systems and remain there undetected.	
31	Security Vulnerability and Exploits	Hardware Vulnerabilities	Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws. For example, the type of memory called RAM basically consists of lots of capacitors (a component which can hold an electrical charge) installed very close to one another. However, it was soon discovered that, due to their close proximity, changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor capacitors. Based on this design flaw, an exploit called Rowhammer was created. By repeatedly accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit triggers electrical interferences that eventually corrupt the data stored inside the RAM.  Google security researchers discovered Meltdown and Spectre, two hardware vulnerabilities that affect almost all central processing units (CPUs) released since 1995 within desktops, laptops, servers, smartphones, smart devices and cloud services.  Attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities can read all memory from a given system (Meltdown), as well as data handled by other applications (Spectre). The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability exploitations are referred to as side-channel attacks (information is gained from the implementation of a computer system). They have the ability to compromise large amounts of memory data because the attacks can be run multiple times on a system with very little possibility of a crash or other error.  Hardware vulnerabilities are specific to device models and are not generally exploited through random compromising attempts. While hardware exploits are more common in highly targeted attacks, traditional malware protection and good physical security are sufficient protection for the everyday user.	
32	Security Vulnerability and Exploits	Software Vulnerabilities	Software vulnerabilities are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application code.  The SYNful Knock vulnerability allowed attackers to gain control of enterprise-grade routers, such as the legacy Cisco ISR routers, from which they could monitor all network communication and infect other network devices.  This vulnerability was introduced into the system when an altered IOS version was installed on the routers. To avoid this, you should always verify the integrity of the downloaded IOS image and limit the physical access of such equipment to authorized personnel only.	
33	Security Vulnerability and Exploits	Categorizing Software Vulnerabilities	Most software security vulnerabilities fall into several main categories.	[     {         "title": "Buffer overflow",         "content": "Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. A vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By changing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, the application can access memory allocated to other processes. This can lead to a system crash or data compromise, or provide escalation of privileges."     },     {         "title": "Non-validated input",         "content": "Programs often require data input, but this incoming data could have malicious content, designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way. For example, consider a program that receives an image for processing. A malicious user could craft an image file with invalid image dimensions. The maliciously crafted dimensions could force the program to allocate buffers of incorrect and unexpected sizes."     },     {         "title": "Race conditions",         "content": "This vulnerability describes a situation where the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs. A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order or at the proper time."     },     {         "title": "Weaknesses in security practices",         "content": "Systems and sensitive data can be protected through techniques such as authentication, authorization and encryption. Developers should stick to using security techniques and libraries that have already been created, tested and verified and should not attempt to create their own security algorithms. These will only likely introduce new vulnerabilities."     },     {         "title": "Access control problems",         "content": "Access control is the process of controlling who does what and ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resource, such as a file, and what they can do with it, such as read or change the file. Many security vulnerabilities are created by the improper use of access controls."     } ]
34	Security Vulnerability and Exploits	Software Updates	The goal of software updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities. Microsoft, Apple and other operating system producers release patches and updates almost every day and applications such as web browsers, mobile apps and web servers are often updated by the companies or organizations responsible for them.  Despite the fact that organizations put a lot of effort into finding and patching software vulnerabilities, new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. That’s why some organizations use third party security researchers who specialize in finding vulnerabilities in software, or actually invest in their own penetration testing teams dedicated to search, find and patch software vulnerabilities before they can get exploited.	
35	The Cybersecurity Landscape	Cryptocurrency	Cryptocurrency is digital money that can be used to buy goods and services, using strong encryption techniques to secure online transactions. Banks, governments and even companies like Microsoft and AT&T are very aware of its importance and are jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon!	[     {         "title": "Send",         "content": "Cryptocurrency owners keep their money in encrypted, virtual 'wallets.' When a transaction takes place between the owners of two digital wallets, the details are recorded in a decentralized, electronic ledger or blockchain system. This means it is carried out with a degree of anonymity and is self-managed, with no interference from third parties such as central banks or government entities."     },     {         "title": "Mining",         "content": "Approximately every ten minutes, special computers collect data about the latest cryptocurrency transactions, turning them into mathematical puzzles to maintain confidentiality. These transactions are then verified through a technical and highly complex process known as 'mining.' This step typically involves an army of ‘miners’ working on high-end PCs to solve mathematical puzzles and authenticate transactions."     },     {         "title": "Transaction",         "content": "Once verified, the ledger is updated and electronically copied and disseminated worldwide to anyone belonging to the blockchain network, effectively completing a transaction."     } ]
36	The Cybersecurity Landscape	Cryptojacking	Cryptojacking is an emerging threat that hides on a user’s computer, mobile phone, tablet, laptop or server, using that machine’s resources to 'mine’ cryptocurrencies without the user's consent or knowledge.  Many victims of cryptojacking didn’t even know they’d been hacked until it was too late!	
37	Protecting Your Devices and Network	Protecting Your Computing Devices	Your computing devices are the portal to your online life, storing a lot of your personal data. Therefore, it’s important to protect the security of your devices.	[     {         "title": "Turn the firewall on",         "content": "You should use at least one type of firewall (either a software firewall or a hardware firewall on a router) to protect your device from unauthorized access. The firewall should be turned on and constantly updated to prevent hackers from accessing your personal or organization data."     },     {         "title": "Install antivirus and antispyware",         "content": "Malicious software, such as viruses and spyware, are designed to gain unauthorized access to your computer and your data. Once installed, viruses can destroy your data and slow down your computer. They can even take over your computer and broadcast spam emails using your account. Spyware can monitor your online activities, collect your personal information or produce unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser while you are online. To prevent this, you should only ever download software from trusted websites. However, you should always use antivirus software to provide another layer of protection. This software, which often includes antispyware, is designed to scan your computer and incoming email for viruses and delete them. Keeping your software up to date will protect your computer from any new malicious software that emerges."     },     {         "title": "Manage your operating system and browser",         "content": "Hackers are always trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities that may exist in your operating system (such as Microsoft Windows or macOS) or web browser (such as Google Chrome or Apple Safari). Therefore, to protect your computer and your data, you should set the security settings on your computer and browser to medium level or higher. You should also regularly update your computer's operating system, including your web browser, and download and install the latest software patches and security updates from the vendors."     },     {         "title": "Set up password protection",         "content": "All of your computing devices, including PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, should be password protected to prevent unauthorized access. Any stored information, especially sensitive or confidential data, should be encrypted. You should only store necessary information on your mobile device, in case it is stolen or lost. Remember, if any one of your devices is compromised, the criminals may be able to access all of your data through your cloud storage service provider, such as iCloud or Google Drive."     } ]
38	Protecting Your Devices and Network	Wireless Network Security at Home	Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the service set identifier (SSID). Although a wireless router can be configured so that it doesn’t broadcast the SSID, this should not be considered adequate security for a wireless network.  Hackers will be aware of the preset SSID and default password. Therefore, these details should be changed to prevent intruders from entering your home wireless network. Furthermore, you should encrypt wireless communication by enabling wireless security and the WPA2 encryption feature on your wireless router. But be aware, even with WPA2 encryption enabled, a wireless network can still be vulnerable.  This vulnerability can be exploited by key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) by intruders. In simple terms, attackers break the encryption between a wireless router and a wireless device, giving them access to network data. This flaw affects all modern, protected Wi-Fi networks.  To mitigate this situation, you should:  •        update all wireless capable devices such as routers, laptops and mobile devices, as soon as security updates become available •        use a wired connection for any devices with a wired network interface card (NIC) •        use a trusted virtual private network (VPN) service when accessing a wireless network.	
39	Protecting Your Devices and Network	Public Wi-Fi Risks	When you are away from home, you can access your online information and surf the Internet via public wireless networks or Wi-Fi hotspots. However, there are some risks involved, which mean that it is best not to access or send any personal information when using public Wi-Fi.  You should always verify that your device isn’t configured with file and media sharing and that it requires user authentication with encryption.  You should also use an encrypted VPN service to prevent others from intercepting your information (known as ‘eavesdropping’) over a public wireless network. This service gives you secure access to the Internet, by encrypting the connection between your device and the VPN server. Even if hackers intercept a data transmission in an encrypted VPN tunnel, they will not be able to decipher it.	
40	Protecting Your Devices and Network	A Strong Password	Here are a few simple tips to help you when choosing a strong password.  •        Do not use dictionary words or names in any languages •        Do not use common misspellings of dictionary words •        If possible, use special characters such as ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) •        Do not use computer names or account names •        Use a password with more than ten characters	
41	Protecting Your Devices and Network	Using a Passphrase	In order to prevent unauthorized access to your devices, you should consider using passphrases instead of passwords. A passphrase generally takes the form of a sentence (‘Acat th@tlov3sd0gs.’), making it easier for you to remember. And because it’s longer than a typical password, it’s less vulnerable to dictionary or brute-force attacks.  •        Choose a statement that is meaningful to you. •        Add special characters such as ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ). •        The longer the better. •        Avoid common or famous statements, for example, lyrics from a popular song.	
42	Protecting Your Devices and Network	Password Guidelines	The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published improved password requirements. NIST standards are intended for government applications but can serve as a standard for other sectors as well.  These guidelines aim to place responsibility for user verification on service providers and ensure a better experience for users overall. They state:  •        Passwords should be at least eight characters, but no more than 64 characters. •        Common, easily guessed passwords, such as ‘password’ or ‘abc123’ should not be used. •        There should be no composition rules, such as having to include lower and uppercase letters and numbers. •        Users should be able to see the password when typing, to help improve accuracy. •        All printing characters and spaces should be allowed. •        There should be no password hints. •        There should be no password expiration period. •        There should be no knowledge-based authentication, such as having to provide answers to secret questions or verify transaction history.	
43	Data Maintenance	What Is Encryption?	Encryption is the process of converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and access it in its original form.  Note that the encryption itself does not prevent someone from intercepting the data. It can only prevent an unauthorized person from viewing or accessing the content. In fact, some criminals may decide to simply encrypt your data and make it unusable until you pay a ransom.	
44	Data Maintenance	How Do You Encrypt Your Data?	Software programs are used to encrypt files, folders and even entire drives.  Encrypting File System (EFS) is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. It is directly linked to a specific user account and only the user that encrypts the data will be able to access it after it has been encrypted using EFS.	[     {         "title": "Step 1",         "content": "Select one or more files or folders."     },     {         "title": "Step 2",         "content": "Right click the selected data and go to 'Properties.'"     },     {         "title": "Step 3",         "content": "Find and click 'Advanced.'"     },     {         "title": "Step 4",         "content": "Select the 'Encrypt contents to secure data' check box."     },     {         "title": "Step 5",         "content": "Files and folders that have been encrypted with EFS are displayed in green as shown here."     } ]
45	Data Maintenance	Back Up Your Data	Having a backup may prevent the loss of irreplaceable data. To back up data properly, you will need an additional storage location for the data and you must copy the data to that location regularly.	[     {         "title": "Home network",         "content": "Storing your data locally means that you have total control of it."     },     {         "title": "Secondary location",         "content": "You could copy all of your data to a network attached storage device (NAS), a simple external hard drive or maybe even back up important folders on thumb drives, CDs, DVDs or tapes. In this scenario, you are the owner of the data and you are totally responsible for the cost and maintenance of the storage device equipment."     },     {         "title": "The cloud",         "content": "You could subscribe to a cloud storage service, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cost of this service will depend on the amount of storage space you need, so you may need to be more selective about what data you back up. You will have access to your backup data as long as you have access to your account. One of the benefits of using a cloud storage service is that your data is safe in the event of a storage device failure or if you experience an extreme situation such as a fire or theft."     } ]
46	Data Maintenance	How Do You Delete Your Data Permanently?	Have you ever had to delete data or get rid of a hard drive? If so, did you take any precautions to safeguard the data to keep it from falling into the wrong hands?	[     {         "title": "Data Obliteration",         "content": "To erase data so that it is no longer recoverable, it must be overwritten with ones and zeroes multiple times, using tools specifically designed to do just that. SDelete from Microsoft claims to have the ability to remove sensitive files completely. Shred for Linux and Secure Empty Trash for Mac OS X claim to provide a similar service."     },     {         "title": "Data Annihilation",         "content": "The only way to be certain that data or files are not recoverable is to physically destroy the hard drive or storage device. Many criminals have taken advantage of files thought to be impenetrable or irrecoverable!"     } ]
47	Who Owns Your Data?	Understand the Terms	The Terms of Service will include a number of sections, from user rights and responsibilities to disclaimers and account modification terms.	[     {         "title": "Data Use Policy",         "content": "The data use policy outlines how the service provider will collect, use and share your data."     },     {         "title": "Privacy Settings",         "content": "The privacy settings allow you to control who sees information about you and who can access your profile or account data."     },     {         "title": "Security Policy",         "content": "The security policy outlines what the company is doing to secure the data it obtains from you."     } ]
48	Who Owns Your Data?	The Data Use Policy	The data use policy of the company you used to set up the account states that for any content you publish: “you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings)”.	
49	Who Owns Your Data?	Before You Sign Up	What factors should you consider before you sign up to an online service?  •        Have you read the Terms of Service? •        What are your rights regarding your data? •        Can you request a copy of your data? •        What can the provider do with the data you upload? •        What happens to your data when you close your account?	
50	Safeguarding Your Online Privacy	Two Factor Authentication	Popular online services, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple and Microsoft, use two factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for account logins.  Besides your username and password or personal identification number (PIN), two factor authentication requires a second token to verify your identity. This may be a:  •        physical object such as a credit card, mobile phone or fob •        biometric scan such as a fingerprint or facial and voice recognition •        verification code sent via SMS or email.	
51	Safeguarding Your Online Privacy	Open Authorization	Open authorization (OAuth) is an open standard protocol that allows you to use your credentials to access third-party applications without exposing your password.	[     {         "title": "Login",         "content": "You are looking forward to registering for Cisco's 'Cybersecurity Essentials,' the next course in this series, to help you develop your career.

The portal gives you the option of logging in using your credentials from a social media website such as Facebook or via another account such as Google."     },     {         "title": "Get Started",         "content": "So instead of having to reset your login details, you log into the eLearning portal using your existing social media accounts and register for your next course with ease. You can't wait to get started!"     } ]
52	Safeguarding Your Online Privacy	Social Sharing	In order to safeguard your privacy on social media, it’s important to share as little personal information as possible. You should also check your social media settings so that only people you know can see your activities or engage in conversations with you.  The more information you share online, the easier it is for someone to create a profile about you and take advantage of you, both online and offline.	
53	Safeguarding Your Online Privacy	Email and Web Browser Privacy	These problems can be minimized by enabling the in-private browsing mode on your web browser. Many of the most commonly used web browsers have their own name for private browser mode:  •        Microsoft Internet Explorer: InPrivate •        Google Chrome: Incognito •        Mozilla Firefox: Private tab or private window •        Safari: Private browsing  When private mode is enabled, cookies — files saved to your device to indicate what websites you’ve visited — are disabled. Therefore, any temporary internet files are removed and your browsing history is deleted when you close the window or program. This may help to prevent others from gathering information about your online activities and trying to entice you to buy something with targeted ads.  Even with private browsing enabled and cookies disabled, companies are constantly developing new ways of fingerprinting users in order to track their online behavior. For example, some intermediary devices, like routers, can gather information about a user’s web surfing history.	
54	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Security Appliances	Security appliances can be standalone devices like a router or software tools that are run on a network device. They fall into six general categories.	[     {         "title": "Routers",         "content": "While routers are primarily used to interconnect various network segments together, they usually also provide basic traffic filtering capabilities. This information can help you define which computers from a given network segment can communicate with which network segments."     },     {         "title": "Firewalls",         "content": "Firewalls can look deeper into the network traffic itself and identify malicious behavior that has to be blocked.

55	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Firewalls	In computer networking, a firewall is designed to control or filter which communications are allowed in and which are allowed out of a device or network. A firewall can be installed on a single computer with the purpose of protecting that one computer (host-based firewall) or it can be a standalone network device that protects an entire network of computers and all of the host devices on that network (network-based firewall).  As computer and network attacks have become more sophisticated, new types of firewalls have been developed, which serve different purposes.	[     {         "title": "Network layer firewall",         "content": "This filters communications based on source and destination IP addresses."     },     {         "title": "Transport layer firewall",         "content": "Filters communications based on source and destination data ports, as well as connection states."     },     {         "title": "Application layer firewall",         "content": "Filters communications based on an application, program or service."     },     {         "title": "Context aware layer firewall",         "content": "Filters communications based on the user, device, role, application type and threat profile."     },     {         "title": "Proxy server",         "content": "Filters web content requests like URLs, domain names and media types."     },     {         "title": "Reverse proxy server",         "content": "Placed in front of web servers, reverse proxy servers protect, hide, offload and distribute access to web servers."     },     {         "title": "Network address translation (NAT) firewall",         "content": "This firewall hides or masquerades the private addresses of network hosts."     },     {         "title": "Host-based firewall",         "content": "Filters ports and system service calls on a single computer operating system."     } ]
56	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Port Scanning	In networking, each application running on a device is assigned an identifier called a port number. This port number is used on both ends of the transmission so that the right data is passed to the correct application. Port scanning is a process of probing a computer, server or other network host for open ports. It can be used maliciously as a reconnaissance tool to identify the operating system and services running on a computer or host, or it can be used harmlessly by a network administrator to verify network security policies on the network.	
57	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems	Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are security measures deployed on a network to detect and prevent malicious activities.	[     {         "title": "IDS",         "content": "An IDS can either be a dedicated network device or one of several tools in a server, firewall or even a host computer operating system, such as Windows or Linux, that scans data against a database of rules or attack signatures, looking for malicious traffic. If a match is detected, the IDS will log the detection and create an alert for a network administrator. It will not take action and therefore it will not prevent attacks from happening. The job of the IDS is to detect, log and report. The scanning performed by the IDS slows down the network (known as latency). To prevent network delay, an IDS is usually placed offline, separate from regular network traffic. Data is copied or mirrored by a switch and then forwarded to the IDS for offline detection."     },     {         "title": "IPS",         "content": "An IPS can block or deny traffic based on a positive rule or signature match. One of the most well-known IPS/IDS systems is Snort. The commercial version of Snort is Cisco's Sourcefire. Sourcefire can perform real-time traffic and port analysis, logging, content searching and matching, as well as detect probes, attacks and execute port scans. It also integrates with other third-party tools for reporting, performance and log analysis."     } ]
58	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Real-Time Detection	Many organizations today are unable to detect attacks until days or even months after they occur.  Detecting attacks in real time requires actively scanning for attacks using firewall and IDS/IPS network devices. Next generation client and server malware detection with connections to online global threat centers must also be used. Today, active scanning devices and software must detect network anomalies using context-based analysis and behavior detection.  DDoS is one of the biggest attack threats requiring real-time detection and response. For many organizations, regularly occurring DDoS attacks cripple Internet servers and network availability. These attacks are extremely difficult to defend against because the attacks originate from hundreds, even thousands, of zombie hosts, and the attacks appear as legitimate traffic.	
59	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Protecting Against Malware	One way of defending against zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats (APTs) is to use an enterprise-level advanced malware detection solution, like Cisco’s Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) Threat Grid.  This is client/server software that can be deployed on host endpoints, as a standalone server or on other network security devices. It analyzes millions of files and correlates them against hundreds of millions of other analyzed malware artifacts for behaviors that reveal an APT. This approach provides a global view of malware attacks, campaigns and their distribution.	
60	Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies	Security Best Practices	Many national and professional organizations have published lists of security best practices. Some of the most helpful guidelines are found in organizational repositories such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security Resource Center.	[     {         "title": "Perform a risk assessment",         "content": "Knowing and understanding the value of what you are protecting will help to justify security expenditures."     },     {         "title": "Create a security policy",         "content": "Create a policy that clearly outlines the organization's rules, job roles, and responsibilities and expectations for employees."     },     {         "title": "Physical security measures",         "content": "Restrict access to networking closets and server locations, as well as fire suppression."     },     {         "title": "Human resources security measures",         "content": "Background checks should be completed for all employees."     },     {         "title": "Perform and test backups",         "content": "Back up information regularly and test data recovery from backups."     },     {         "title": "Maintain security patches and updates",         "content": "Regularly update server, client and network device operating systems and programs."     },     {         "title": "Employ access controls",         "content": "Configure user roles and privilege levels as well as strong user authentication."     },     {         "title": "Regularly test incident response",         "content": "Employ an incident response team and test emergency response scenarios."     },     {         "title": "Implement a network monitoring, analytics and management tool",         "content": "Choose a security monitoring solution that integrates with other technologies."     },     {         "title": "Implement network security devices",         "content": "Use next generation routers, firewalls and other security appliances."     },     {         "title": "Implement a comprehensive endpoint security solution",         "content": "Use enterprise level antimalware and antivirus software."     },     {         "title": "Educate users",         "content": "Provide training to employees in security procedures."     },     {         "title": "Encrypt data",         "content": "Encrypt all sensitive organizational data, including email."     } ]
61	Behavior Approach to Cybersecurity	Behavior-Based Security	Behavior-based security is a form of threat detection that involves capturing and analyzing the flow of communication between a user on the local network and a local or remote destination. Any changes in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies, and may indicate an attack.	[     {         "title": "Honeypots",         "content": "A honeypot is a behavior-based detection tool that lures the attacker in by appealing to their predicted pattern of malicious behavior. Once the attacker is inside the honeypot, the network administrator can capture, log and analyze their behavior so that they can build a better defense."     },     {         "title": "Cisco's Cyber Threat Defense Solution Architecture",         "content": "This security architecture uses behavior-based detection and indicators to provide greater visibility, context and control. The aim is to know who is carrying out the attack, what type of attack they are performing and where, when and how the attack is taking place. This security architecture uses many security technologies to achieve this goal."     } ]
62	Behavior Approach to Cybersecurity	NetFlow	NetFlow technology is used to gather information about data flowing through a network, including who and what devices are in the network, and when and how users and devices access the network.  NetFlow is an important component in behavior-based detection and analysis. Switches, routers and firewalls equipped with NetFlow can report information about data entering, leaving and traveling through the network.   This information is sent to NetFlow collectors that collect, store and analyze NetFlow data, which can be used to establish baseline behaviors on more than 90 attributes, such as source and destination IP address.	
63	Behavior Approach to Cybersecurity	Penetration Testing	Penetration testing, commonly known as pen testing, is the act of assessing a computer system, network or organization for security vulnerabilities. A pen test seeks to breach systems, people, processes and code to uncover vulnerabilities which could be exploited. This information is then used to improve the system’s defenses to ensure that it is better able to withstand cyber attacks in the future.	[     {         "title": "Planning",         "content": "The pen tester gathers as much information as possible about a target system or network, its potential vulnerabilities and exploits to use against it. This involves conducting passive or active reconnaissance (footprinting) and vulnerability research."     },     {         "title": "Scanning",         "content": "The pen tester carries out active reconnaissance to probe a target system or network and identify potential weaknesses which, if exploited, could give an attacker access."     },     {         "title": "Gaining Access",         "content": "The pen tester will attempt to gain access to a target system and sniff network traffic, using various methods to exploit the system."     },     {         "title": "Maintaining Access",         "content": "The pen tester will maintain access to the target to find out what data and systems are vulnerable to exploitation. It is important that they remain undetected, typically using backdoors, Trojan horses, rootkits and other covert channels to hide their presence. When this infrastructure is in place, the pen tester will then proceed to gather the data that they consider valuable."     },     {         "title": "Analysis and reporting",          "content": "The pen tester will provide feedback via a report that recommends updates to products, policies and training to improve an organization's security."     } ]
64	Behavior Approach to Cybersecurity	Impact Reduction	While most organizations today are aware of common security threats and put considerable effort into preventing them, no set of security practices is foolproof. Therefore, organizations must be prepared to contain the damage if a security breach occurs. And they must act fast!	[     {         "title": "Communicate the issue",         "content": "Communication creates transparency, which is critical in this type of situation. Internally, all employees should be informed and a clear call to action communicated. Externally, all clients should be informed through direct communication and official announcements."     },     {         "title": "Be sincere and accountable",         "content": "Respond to the breach in an honest and genuine way, taking responsibility where the organization is at fault."     },     {         "title": "Provide the details",         "content": "Be open and explain why the breach took place and what information was compromised. Organizations are generally expected to take care of any client costs associated with identity theft services required as a result of a security breach."     },     {         "title": "Find the cause",         "content": "Take steps to understand what caused and facilitated the breach. This may involve hiring forensics experts to research and find out the details."     },     {         "title": "Apply lessons learned",          "content": "Make sure that any lessons learned from forensic investigations are applied to prevent similar breaches from happening in the future."     },     {         "title": "Check, and check again",         "content": "Attackers will often attempt to leave a backdoor to facilitate future breaches. To prevent this from happening, make sure that all systems are clean, no backdoors are installed and nothing else has been compromised."     },     {         "title": "Educate",         "content": "Raise awareness, train and educate employees, partners and clients on how to prevent future breaches."     } ]
65	Behavior Approach to Cybersecurity	What Is Risk Management?	Risk management is the formal process of continuously identifying and assessing risk in an effort to reduce the impact of threats and vulnerabilities. You cannot eliminate risk completely but you can determine acceptable levels by weighing up the impact of a threat with the cost of implementing controls to mitigate it. The cost of a control should never be more than the value of the asset you are protecting.	[     {         "title": "Frame the risk",         "content": "Identify the threats that increase risk. Threats may include processes, products, attacks, potential failure or disruption of services, negative perception of an organization's reputation, potential legal liability or loss of intellectual property."     },     {         "title": "Assess the risk",         "content": "Determine the severity that each threat poses. For example, some threats may have the potential to bring an entire organization to a standstill, while other threats may be only minor inconveniences. Risk can be prioritized by assessing financial impact (a quantitative analysis) or scaled impact on an organization's operation (a qualitative analysis)."     },     {         "title": "Respond to the risk",         "content": "Develop an action plan to reduce overall organization risk exposure, detailing where risk can be eliminated, mitigated, transferred or accepted."     },     {         "title": "Monitor the risk",         "content": "Continuously review any risk reduced through elimination, mitigation or transfer actions. Remember, not all risks can be eliminated, so you will need to closely monitor any threats that have been accepted."     } ]
66	Cisco's Approach to Cybersecurity	Cisco's CSIRT	Many large organizations have a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to receive, review and respond to computer security incident reports. Cisco CSIRT goes a step further and provides proactive threat assessment, mitigation planning, incident trend analysis and security architecture review in an effort to prevent security incidents from happening.  Cisco’s CSIRT takes a proactive approach, collaborating with the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the National Safety Information Exchange (NSIE), the Defense Security Information Exchange (DSIE) and the DNS Operations Analysis and Research Center (DNS-OARC) to ensure we stay up-to-date with new developments.  There are several national and public CSIRT organizations, like the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, that are available to help organizations and national CSIRTs to develop, operate and improve their incident management capabilities.	
67	Cisco's Approach to Cybersecurity	Security Playbook	One of the best ways to prepare for a security breach is to prevent it. Organizations should provide guidance on:  •        how to identify the cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities •        the implementation of safeguards and personnel training •        a flexible response plan that minimizes the impact and damage in the event of a security breach •        security measures and processes that need to be put in place in the aftermath of a security breach.  A security playbook is a collection of repeatable queries or reports that outline a standardized process for incident detection and response. Ideally, a security playbook should:  •        highlight how to identify and automate the response to common threats such as the detection of malware-infected machines, suspicious network activity or irregular authentication attempts. •        describe and clearly define inbound and outbound traffic. •        provide summary information including trends, statistics and counts. •        provide usable and quick access to key statistics and metrics. •        correlate events across all relevant data sources.	
68	Cisco's Approach to Cybersecurity	Tools for Incident Detection and Prevention	There are a range of tools used to detect and prevent security incidents.	[     {         "title": "SIEM",         "content": "A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system collects and analyzes security alerts, logs and other real-time and historical data from security devices on the network to facilitate early detection of cyber attacks."     },     {         "title": "DLP",         "content": "A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system is designed to stop sensitive data from being stolen from or escaping a network. It monitors and protects data in three different states: data in use (data being accessed by a user), data in motion (data traveling through the network) and data at rest (data stored in a computer network or device)."     } ]
69	Legal and Ethical Issues	Legal Issues in Cybersecurity	In order to protect against attacks, cybersecurity professionals must have the same skills as the attackers. However, cybersecurity professionals use their skills within the bounds of the law.	[     {         "title": "Personal legal issues",         "content": "At work or home, you may have the opportunity and skills to hack another person's computer or network. But there is an old saying, 'Just because you can does not mean you should.' Most hacks leave tracks, which can be traced back to you. Cybersecurity professionals develop many skills, which can be used positively or illegally. There is always a huge demand for those who choose to put their cyber skills to good use within legal bounds."     },     {         "title": "Corporate legal issues",         "content": "Most countries have cybersecurity laws in place, which businesses and organizations must abide by. In some cases, if you break cybersecurity laws while doing your job, the organization may be punished and you could lose your job. In other cases, you could be prosecuted, fined and possibly sentenced. In general, if you are unsure whether an action or behavior might be illegal, assume that it is illegal and do not do it. Always check with the legal or HR department in the organization."     },     {         "title": "International law and cybersecurity",         "content": "International cybersecurity law is a constantly evolving field. Cyber attacks take place in cyberspace, an electronic space created, maintained and owned by both the public and private entities. There are no traditional geographic boundaries in cyberspace. To further complicate issues, it is much easier to mask the source of a attack in cyberwarfare than in conventional warfare. The global society is still debating how best to deal with cyberspace. Country practice, opinio juris (a sense on behalf of a country that it is bound to the law in question) and any treaties drafted will shape international cybersecurity law."     } ]
70	Education and careers	Professional Certifications	Cybersecurity certifications are a great way for you to verify your skills and knowledge and can also boost your career.	[     {         "title": "Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) Cybersecurity",         "content": "This is an entry-level certification for newcomers who are preparing to start their career in the cybersecurity field. It is aimed at high school and early college students as well as those interested in a career change. This certificate does not expire or require periodic recertification."     },     {         "title": "CompTIA Security+",         "content": "This is an entry-level security certification that meets the U.S. Department of Defense Directive 8570.01-M requirements, which is an important item for anyone looking to work in IT security for the federal government."     },     {         "title": "EC Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)",         "content": "This certification tests your understanding and knowledge of how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems using the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker but in a lawful and legitimate manner."     },     {         "title": "ISC2 Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)",         "content": "This is the most recognizable and popular security certification. In order to take the exam, you need to have at least five years of relevant industry experience."     },     {         "title": "Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate",         "content": "This certification validates the skills required of associate-level cybersecurity analysts within security operations centers."     } ]
